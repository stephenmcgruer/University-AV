# Advanced Vision

This repository contains my coursework for the 4th Year [Advanced Vision](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/av) course, taken in 2011/2012. There were three pieces of coursework during the AV course: one individual and two pair courseworks.

The first coursework involved writing a Wikipedia-style article on a vision-related topic; my choice was 'Hexagonal Coordinate Systems'.

The second coursework involved extracting hand movements from a sequence of images, and classifying the whole sequence into one move from a game of 'Rock, Paper, Scissors'. My partner for this coursework was the charming and brilliant [Wenqi Yao](http://wenkakes.com/).

The third and final coursework involved working with depth data to extract regions of interest from a video sequence, and projecting images onto identified surfaces. My partner for this coursework was [Sean Wilson](https://github.com/besiix).

Coursework for other courses can be found in my main [University Coursework](https://github.com/stephenmcgruer/University) repository.
